=============
 ``z3.wasm``
=============

This repo contains a build script to compile `Z3 <https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/>`_ to WebAssembly using `emscripten <https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/>`_.  To make things more reproducible, the build script may be run in a `Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/>`_ VM.

Loading Z3 is fairly slow (~15 seconds on Chrome, though less than 1 second on Firefox), but verification typically is within a factor 2 to 5 of native performance.

Pre-build archives are available at https://github.com/cpitclaudel/z3.wasm/releases.  Demo at https://people.csail.mit.edu/cpitcla/z3.wasm/z3.html.

Building
========

In a VM
-------

Install `Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/>`_, then run this::

   vagrant up
   vagrant ssh
   VAGRANT=true /vagrant/z3.sh

The first build can take up to two hours (emscripten may require a custom build of LLVM, Z3 is large, and all of this is running in a VM).  The output (``z3w.js``, ``z3w.wasm``, ``z3smt2w.js``, and ``z3smt2w.wasm``) is written to ``build/z3/``.

Some Vagrant configurations can cause clang to crash or Vagrant to hang.
Building on a physical machine is the most reliable workaround.

Natively
--------

On Debian/Ubuntu systems, you may prefer to build natively, which will be much faster.  In that case, just run ``./z3.sh``, which will place all outputs in ``build/``.

Using the generated code
========================

The build script produces two artefacts: a copy of the full Z3 command line application (``z3w.js``, ``z3w.wasm``), and a Javascript version of a small SMT2 REPL-style API, built by linking ``z3smt2.c`` with ``libz3``.

``z3w.js``
----------

There is a small example script using nodejs for demonstration purposes in the repo::

  $ nodejs z3test.js /nodefs/test.smt2
  sat
  (model
    (define-fun y () Int
      3)
    (define-fun x () Int
      2)
    (define-fun z () Int
      1)
    (define-fun g ((x!0 Int) (x!1 Int)) Int
      (ite (and (= x!0 2) (= x!1 2)) 0
        0))
    (define-fun f ((x!0 Int)) Int
      (ite (= x!0 2) (- 1)
      (ite (= x!0 3) 1
        (- 1))))
  )
  unsat
  (error "line 14 column 10: model is not available")
  unsat

From a webpage the process is roughly the same: write Z3's input to a file using emscripten's virtual file system, and use ``callMain(args)`` to run Z3.  To capture Z3's output, you can pass a custom ``print`` function to the emscripten module upon initialization.

This is all demoed in ``html/z3.html`` (that example also uses a WebWorker to run Z3, keeping the page responsive while it runs).  Try it like this::

  cp build/z3/z3w.js build/z3/z3w.wasm ./html
  python3 -m http.server
  # Open your browser to http://localhost:8000/html/z3.html

``z3smt2w.js``
--------------

This script exposes a small API useful for verifiers (like F* or Dafny) that interact with Z3 on through pipes.  It exposes the following functions::

  // Create a fresh SMT2 context
  Z3_context smt2Init()

  // Globally set `option` to `value`.
  void smt2SetParam(const char* option, const char* value)

  // Send `query` to `ctx` and fetch the response as a string.
  const char* smt2Ask(Z3_context ctx, const char* query)

  // Release the resources used by `ctx`.
  void smt2Destroy(Z3_context ctx)

There is a small example script using nodejs for demonstration purposes in the repo::

  $ nodejs ./z3smt2test.js
  sat
  (model
    (define-fun y () Int
      4)
    (define-fun x () Int
      2)
    (define-fun z () Int
      0)
    (define-fun g ((x!0 Int) (x!1 Int)) Int
      (ite (and (= x!0 2) (= x!1 2)) 0
        0))
    (define-fun f ((x!0 Int)) Int
      (ite (= x!0 2) (- 1)
      (ite (= x!0 4) 1
        (- 1))))
  )
  unsat
  (error "line 1 column 11: model is not available")
  unsat


Check the source code of F*.js for an example of how to use this in a larger application.

Known issues, tips
==================

Chrome precompiles WebAssembly programs before running them â€” this makes startup slow, though verification after that is fast.  The recommendation is to cache compiled modules, but Chrome doesn't (2018-03) allow that yet.

Firefox is much better at this, though the code eventually does run a slower.

Compression
-----------

The limited ``z3smt2.wasm`` is a bit smaller than the full Z3: use that if you can.

On Apache servers, use the following to compress WASM files (gzipping saves about 75%)::

   AddType application/wasm .wasm
   AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/wasm
